# CI for the whole Cargo workspace. Although having two relatively independent
# crates in this workspace (as they do not get released together, as for example
# tokio with its sub crates), a PR for a certain CI may report errors in the
# other workspace members. I think this is unfortunate. I've experimented with
# CI runs per workspace member but the complexity in the end was not worth it.
# Instead, it is the right thing that the CI always covers the whole repository
# and that it is as stable as possible.
